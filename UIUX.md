The layout structure of the page is reasonable, and each individual function is allocated to each individual module in a reasonable manner, and is segmented using a border. The main color of the entire system is friendly blue, while the dangerous color is red, providing a good user experience. Provide confirmation prompts for some dangerous operations to prevent users from making mistakes. Provide friendly prompts for each user action to enhance the interactivity of the system. Provide specific success prompts for successful operations, and vice versa, provide error prompts. Each functional module contains a title that clearly identifies the theme and functionality of the current module. The global navigation bar is very convenient for users to move the home page. When a module data is empty, display a friendly empty state. Adjust the page layout reasonably and aesthetically under different screen sizes to ensure that the elements of the page do not collapse.
