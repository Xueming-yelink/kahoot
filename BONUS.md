I extensively used native operation array methods for code optimization throughout the entire system, such as using reduce to score and sum the total problem time, and using filter for data filtering. Encapsulate various functions into function calls to ensure the cleanliness and maintainability of the system code. Encapsulate global data requests and responses for unified processing. The default data in the system is optimized to ensure that the system is fault-tolerant before receiving data and that the system does not crash.
