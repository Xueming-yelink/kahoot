I extensively used native operation array methods for code optimization throughout the entire system, such as using reduce to score and sum the total problem time, and using filter for data filtering. Encapsulate various functions into function calls to ensure the cleanliness and maintainability of the system code. Encapsulate global data requests and responses for unified processing. Perform the "" on the default data in the system Optimize to ensure that the system performs fault-tolerant processing before receiving data, ensuring that the system does not crash.
